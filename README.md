## Smart-contracts description

The tokens for the bounty and the team are minted after the ICO  is finished.  
There is a special function to return 3rd party tokens that were sent by mistake (function retrieveTokens()).  
Each stage has a direct minting function in wei. This is made to support the external payment gateways.

### Contracts contains
1. _Token_ - Token contract
2. _PreITO_ - PreITO contract
3. _ITO_ - ITO contract
4. _Configurator_ - contract with main configuration for production

### How to manage contract
To start working with contract you should follow next steps:
1. Compile it in Remix with enamble optimization flag and compiler 0.4.18
2. Deploy bytecode with MyEtherWallet. Gas 5100000 (actually 5073514).
3. Call 'deploy' function on addres from (3). Gas 4000000 (actually 3979551). 

Contract manager must call finishMinting after each crowdsale milestone!
To support external mint service manager should specify address by calling _setDirectMintAgent_. After that specified address can direct mint tokens by calling _mintTokensByETHExternal_ and _mintTokensExternal_.

### How to invest
To purchase tokens investor should send ETH (more than minimum 0.1 ETH) to corresponding crowdsale contract.
